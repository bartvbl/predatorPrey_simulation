- 6 infrared proximity sensors. 6 on the front, 2 on the back
	- max detection range: 3-4cm
- view angle of predator: 36 degrees
	- cut into sectors of about 7 degrees. Resulted into 5 vision neurons
	- just check in which photoreceptor the prey lies, set its value to 1 if it is.
- arena is 47x47 cm
- wheels updated every 100ms
- robots were positioned along a horizontal line in the center of the arena. Always positioned at random rotations.
- 100 populations of 100 individuals. Each individual had to face best individuals from previous generation
- two neurons with feedback loops
	- 7-8-7 feedforward?
- the first layer is not stored in the neural network class. Only the hidden and output layer is present.
	
	
procedure:
100 individuals, prey and predator populations
top 10: reproduce 3 times
top 11-20: reproduce 2 times
fill up remaining 50 with randomized networks
